LEVEL FILE FORMAT
files are stored in binary format:

all numbers apart from the first are stored as 2 byte pairs

byte 1: level file version (compatibility check)
bytes 2 - 5: player starting position: x, y

4 and up: data section:
this includes tiles, particle systems, etc.
formatted as follows:

    object id
    object data id + value
    terminator

each object has a unique id, and its parameters have an id.
specific parameters can be set individually

the terminator (255, 255, 255) indicates that the next object has begun

id list:
* = required

id  param id    name
0 0             terminator

1               pink tile all sides
2               pink tile end
3               pink tile pipe

    1           pos x *
    2           pos y *
    3           rotation (degrees) *

4               particle point emitter

    1           pos x *
    2           pos y *
    3           direction (degrees)
    4           spread (degrees)
    5           max particles
    6           emit speed
    7           particle lifetime (10th of a second)
    8           particle lifetime rand (10th of a second)
    9           particle size
    10          particle size rand
    11          particle velocity
    12          particle velocity rand
    13          particle rotation velocity
    14          particle rotation velocity rand
    15          particle drag
